<p align="center">

This repository is an **open-source dataset of <span id="num-samples">13439</span> malicious software packages** (and counting) identified by Datadog, as part of our security research efforts in software supply-chain security. Most of the malicious packages have been identified by [GuardDog](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog).

Current ecosystems:
- npm
- PyPI

## Usage

Malicious samples are available under the **[samples/](samples/)** folder and compressed as an encrypted ZIP file with the password `infected`. The date indicated as part of the file name is the discovery date, not necessarily the package publication date.

You can use the script [extract.sh](./scripts/extract.sh) to automatically extract selected samples in order to perform local analysis on them. Alternatively, you can extract a single sample using:

```
$ unzip -o -P infected samples/pypi/malicious_intent/pydefender/1.0.0/2023-03-20-pydefender-v1.0.0.zip -d /tmp/
Archive:  samples/pypi/malicious_intent/pydefender/1.0.0/2023-03-20-pydefender-v1.0.0.zip
   creating: /tmp/2023-03-20-pydefender-v1.0.0/
```

Samples are separated by both ecosystem and according to whether they are 1) compromised versions of benign packages or 2) packages published with *malicious intent*, those whose primary purpose is to deliver malware.

Each ecosystem subdirectory has a `manifest.json` file that names which packages are included in the dataset.  These files are useful for quickly testing whether a given version of a package can be considered malicious:

* If a package is not in the manifest, the test is inconclusive
* Otherwise:
  - If the manifest entry is `null`, the package has malicious intent: all versions can be considered malicious
  - Otherwise, the package previously suffered a compromise, and the manifest contains a list of affected versions

Malicious software packages provided as part of this repository may contain legitimate, licensed code. In that case, the applicable license is the one of the original package, indicated in the metadata of its `setup.py` 
file.

## Disclaimers

* This repository contains actively malicious software that was published by threat actors. Do not run it on your machine.

* This dataset may suffer from selection bias, as it was mostly identified by a single ruleset ([GuardDog](https://github.com/datadog/guarddog)). As such, it may not accurately represent the landscape of software supply-chain security malware.

## FAQ

### Are you maintaining this dataset?

We will be regularly adding new packages to the dataset.

### How do you know these packages are malicious?

Every single software package included in this dataset has been manually triaged by a human.

### How are you clustering these packages?

At the time, we did not make available the clustering algorithm we use internally to group similar samples and ease analysis. If you have interest, please reach out at securitylabs@datadoghq.com - we'll be happy to talk!

### Do you accept contributions? 

At the time, the repository is not accepting contributions. However, if you'd like to share an interesting finding with us, reach out at securitylabs@datadoghq.com!
